### Things that done

* [Convert candidate page to use templating engine and delete candiates when published](https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/pull/885):
  - Converted individual candidate page and candidate index page to template-based generation like servePackagePage does
  - Added two html templates, candidate-page.html.st and candidate-index.html.st, for these pages
  - Delete candidates automatically after they are published by setting doDelete to True
* [Added publish button on candidate page and show a link to the candidate packages available from the main package](https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/commit/3f2c30ce5614406965994942f5c63d6305870ae4):
  - Added publish button on candidate page so users can publish the candidate directly
  - Added candidate section on the main package page with links
* [Added candidate link on user page](https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/commit/3f2c30ce5614406965994942f5c63d6305870ae4):
  - By adding candidate link, user could go to the candidates page of that package.
  - The link would be wrong if the maintain group is a candidate
